1. Quick and simple .htaccess code with the usual deflate, and  I like this one as I can rid my URLs of the ugly .php, or .html 
   with the RewriteEngine On, RewriteCond, and RewriteRule. Caching can be tweaked with mod_expires+mod_headers^ of course
2. This can obviously be modded for more functionality please write in your thoughts and comments as this is just a starter .htaccess
   add your comments. 
3. This also allows me to simply put the website's page name without the .php in my navigation hyperlinks
   once again of course please improve this.  This is just a basic "get it done quick" .htaccess but lets add more fun shizzle to it.
